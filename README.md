## Conclusion
Evaluating both June and December has given us a good outlook on temperature in our desired location. The next step would be to query information on precipitation on both June and December. There are an abundance of days when a surf shop would be able to operate easily. I think an important approach would be the evaluation of storm seasons in the area.
